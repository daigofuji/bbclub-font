A project for [Boton OnDeck Cup 2013](http://www.ondeckcup.com/), by Daigo Fujiwara [@DaigoFuji](http://twitter.com/daigofuji) <http://daigo.org> September 7-8, 2013

### Problem (user story)

As a front-end developer, I want a easy way to put logos of MLB teams to the website/visualization so that I can easily enhance visuals on my database driven site/data visualization without much fuss

### Solution

**bbclub-font**

An open source(*) icon font that contain 30 MLB team logos that can be used on websites, web app, and data visualization.

Logos are simplified to be used as a small symbols, intended to be used as small visual icons. So no complex lines and may not look as good when it's big. This will also keep the filesize fairly small. 


### By the end of the hackathon, I'll have:

1. a github page with "Getting Started" and documentation.
2. .glyphs file
3. OpenType (.otf) font
4. converted web fonts (.eot, .woff, .ttf, .svg)
5. CSS files

###　Tools that we'll use
* Adobe Illustrator (for creating/editing icons)
* [Glyphs Mini](http://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini/)
* [Font Squirrel](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator)
* Sublime Text text editor (html/css) 


### Usage

Put `<i class=”bbclub-{team abbr}”></i>` to display a logo in place.
